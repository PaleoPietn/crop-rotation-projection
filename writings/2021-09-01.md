# My current standing
## What do I want to do
The aim of this study is to infer the causal connection between amazonian [[forestfire]]s and [[climate change]]. With that in mind I want to infer how the severity and frequency of [[forestfire]]s are causally driven by climate dynamics and how the [[causal interaction]] strength changes according to [[geography]].

To achieve this goal I will use [[empirical dynamic modelling]] as my inference tool. EDM is based on [[state space reconstruction]] based on the [[Taken's Theorem]]. The theorem says that in a [[dynamical system]] with [[time series]] data, the information of one variable is encodet within another variable if they are causally linked. We will use this premise to infer climate dynamics from [[forestfire]] data on the basis that these two are causally linked. There is a interesting paper named EDM for beginners that shows a step by step guide how to use EDM for different modelling steps. I will use it to (2) determine the complexity of the system, (2) quantify the nonlinearity,  (3) determin the causal variables, (4) forecast the severity of the situation and (5) tracking the strength of the interaction.

The amazon [[rainforest]] is a very important [[ecosystem]] for the earth. It accounts for xx% of all [[carbon storage]]on earth and thus is very important to preserve in order to fight [[climate change]].
