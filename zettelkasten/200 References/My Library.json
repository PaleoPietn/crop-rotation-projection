  {"id":"agnolucciLongrunTrendAgricultural2020","abstract":"Abstract\n            Reliable projections of crop production are an essential tool for the design of feasible policy plans to tackle food security and land allocation, and an accurate characterization of the long-run trend in crop yield is the key ingredient in such projections. We provide several contributions adding to our current understanding of the impact of climatic factors on crop yield. First of all, reflecting the complexity of agricultural systems and the time required for any change to diffuse, we show that crop yield in Europe has historically been characterized by a stochastic trend rather than the deterministic specifications normally used in the literature. Secondly, we found that, contrary to previous studies, the trend in crop yield has slowly changed across time rather than being affected by a single abrupt permanent change. Thirdly, we provide strong evidence that climatic factors have played a major role in shaping the long-run trajectory of crop yield over the decades, by influencing both the size and the statistical nature of the trend. In other words, climatic factors are important not only for the year-to-year fluctuations in crop yield but also for its path in the long-run. Finally, we find that, for most countries in this study, the trend in temperature is responsible for a reduction in the long-run growth rate of yield in wheat, whereas a small gain is produced in maize, except for Southern European countries.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,2,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Agnolucci","given":"Paolo"},{"family":"De Lipsis","given":"Vincenzo"}],"citation-key":"agnolucciLongrunTrendAgricultural2020","container-title":"Climatic Change","container-title-short":"Climatic Change","DOI":"10.1007/s10584-019-02622-3","ISSN":"0165-0009, 1573-1480","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,4]]},"language":"en","page":"385-405","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Long-run trend in agricultural yield and climatic factors in Europe","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10584-019-02622-3","volume":"159"},

  {"id":"ibrahimMappingCropTypes2021","abstract":"Reliable crop type maps from satellite data are an essential prerequisite for quantifying crop growth, health, and yields. However, such maps do not exist for most parts of Africa, where smallholder farming is the dominant system. Prevalent cloud cover, small farm sizes, and mixed cropping systems pose substantial challenges when creating crop type maps for sub-Saharan Africa. In this study, we provide a mapping scheme based on freely available Sentinel-2A/B (S2) time series and very high-resolution SkySat data to map the main crops—maize and potato—and intercropping systems including these two crops on the Jos Plateau, Nigeria. We analyzed the spectral-temporal behavior of mixed crop classes to improve our understanding of inter-class spectral mixing. Building on the Framework for Operational Radiometric Correction for Environmental monitoring (FORCE), we preprocessed S2 time series and derived spectral-temporal metrics from S2 spectral bands for the main temporal cropping windows. These STMs were used as input features in a hierarchical random forest classification. Our results provide the first wall-to-wall crop type map for this key agricultural region of Nigeria. Our cropland identification had an overall accuracy of 84%, while the crop type map achieved an average accuracy of 72% for the five relevant crop classes. Our crop type map shows distinctive regional variations in the distribution of crop types. Maize is the dominant crop, followed by mixed cropping systems, including maize–cereals and potato–maize cropping; potato was found to be the least prevalent class. Plot analyses based on a sample of 1166 fields revealed largely homogeneous mapping patterns, demonstrating the effectiveness of our classification system also for intercropped classes, which are temporally and spatially highly heterogeneous. Moreover, we found that small field sizes were dominant in all crop types, regardless of whether or not intercropping was used. Maize–legume and maize exhibited the largest plots, with an area of up to 3 ha and slightly more than 10 ha, respectively; potato was mainly cultivated on fields smaller than 0.5 ha and only a few plots were larger than 1 ha. Besides providing the first spatially explicit map of cropping practices in the core production area of the Jos Plateau, Nigeria, the study also offers guidance for the creation of crop type maps for smallholder-dominated systems with intercropping. Critical temporal windows for crop type differentiation will enable the creation of mapping approaches in support of future smart agricultural practices for aspects such as food security, early warning systems, policies, and extension services.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,2,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Ibrahim","given":"Esther Shupel"},{"family":"Rufin","given":"Philippe"},{"family":"Nill","given":"Leon"},{"family":"Kamali","given":"Bahareh"},{"family":"Nendel","given":"Claas"},{"family":"Hostert","given":"Patrick"}],"citation-key":"ibrahimMappingCropTypes2021","container-title":"Remote Sensing","container-title-short":"Remote Sensing","DOI":"10.3390/rs13173523","ISSN":"2072-4292","issue":"17","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,9,5]]},"language":"en","page":"3523","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Mapping Crop Types and Cropping Systems in Nigeria with Sentinel-2 Imagery","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/13/17/3523","volume":"13"},

  {"id":"zinatiTransitionConventionalOrganic2002","abstract":"Conventional agricultural systems increase per-area food production, but deplete natural resources and degrade both crop and environmental quality. Many of these concerns are addressed by sustainable agricultural systems, integrated pest management, biocontrol, and other alternative systems. Environmental and social concerns have escalated the need for alternative agricultural systems in the last decade. One alternative, the organic farming system, substitutes cultural and biological inputs for synthetically made fertilizers and chemicals for crop nutrition and pest management. Practices used for crop and pest management are similar during transition from conventional to organic farming systems, but produce is not certified to be organic during the transition period. During the transition from conventional to organic farming, growers may face pest control difficulties and lower yields when conventional practices are abandoned. The objectives of this paper are to 1) give an overview of the reasons for converting to organic farming and the challenges that growers face during the transition period, 2) outline some potential strategies for crop, soil, and pest management, and 3) list guidelines and recommendations for pest management during the transition to organic farming. Implementation of crop and pest management practices depends on geographical location, climate, available onsite resources, and history of the land. During transition, growers rely on cultural mechanisms and on organic and mineral sources to improve soil fertility, to build a population of natural enemies to suppress pest populations. Pest management practices during the transition period that reduce pest populations to economically manageable levels include crop rotation, cultivation, cover crops, mulches, crop diversification, resistant varieties, and insect traps. These practices also enrich the soil biota and increase crop yields before produce is certified organically grown.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Zinati","given":"Gladis M."}],"citation-key":"zinatiTransitionConventionalOrganic2002","container-title":"HortTechnology","container-title-short":"horttech","DOI":"10.21273/HORTTECH.12.4.606","ISSN":"1063-0198, 1943-7714","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2002,1]]},"page":"606-610","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Transition from Conventional to Organic Farming Systems: I.
